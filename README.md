# Mission-To-Mars
In this web scraping project we wanted to design an application that scraped websites for data related to the Mission To Mars, we then wanted to take that information and convey it through an html page that was also mobile responsive. We used a number of different applications to achieve this including Mongo, BeautifulSoup, Flask, Splinter, and Bootstrap.
